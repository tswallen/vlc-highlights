# VLC Highlights
This VLC extension allows you to save bookmarks for your media files and store them permanently.

## Overview
Allows you to set "highlights" in your files which are then saved as an m3u file.

## Installation
Create a directory `extensions` at this location if it doesn't exists, then download the `vlc_highlights.lua` file and place it in:

- Windows (all users): `program_files\VideoLAN\VLC\lua\extensions\`
- Windows (current user): `%APPDATA%\vlc\lua\extensions\`
- Linux (all users): `/usr/lib/vlc/lua/extensions/`
- Linux (current user): `~/.local/share/vlc/lua/extensions/`
- Mac OS X (all users):`/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/share/lua/extensions/`
- Mac OS X (current user): `/Users/user_name/Library/Application\ Support/org.videolan.vlc/lua/extensions/`

Change `program_files` to the path of your vlc program
change  `user_name` to your username.

Please note I have never used lua before and have literally no idea what I'm doing.
